# Chicken Tinder: Decide Your Dinner

Chicken Tinder is a web app that allows users to discover restaurants in the NYC area. Users can match with new restaurants they like and leave reviews for them after going there. Reviews let users document their experience at a particular restaurant and help users decide whether they would come back. 

## How it works

First, users can either sign up or log into into their account. If users need to create an account, they will be taken to an onboarding page where they can fill out their basic account information. 

Then, users can start swiping! Similar to Tinder's user interface, users can "swipe" right on restaurants that interest them or "swipe" left to pass on a restaurant. Restaurants that users swipe right on appear in their match history. After eating at a restaurant, users can leave a personal review of their experience with the restaurant. 

## Features
