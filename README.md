# Chicken Tinder: Decide Your Dinner

Chicken Tinder is a web app that allows users to discover restaurants in the NYC area. Users can match with new restaurants that interest them. 

## How it works

First, users can either sign up or log into into their account. If users need to create an account, they will be taken to an onboarding page where they can fill out their basic account information. 

Then, users can start "swiping"! Users can browse through a list of restaurants in a particular city or within a price point and "swipe" right on restaurants that interest them. 

## Features
- Integration with Yelp API to fetch and display restaurant data
- User authentication and authorization using JWT (JSON Web Tokens)
- User profile management with onboarding information
- Backend API development using Node.js Express.js for routing and middleware
- Utilizes cookies to remember user login information
- MongoDB Atlas stores user and restaurant data
- bcrypt hashes user passwords
